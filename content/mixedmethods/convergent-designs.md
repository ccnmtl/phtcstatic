Convergent mixed methods designs are a type of concurrent mixed methods research design. In this design, qualitative and quantitative data are gathered at the same time, but separately from one another, analyzed separately, then the results are compared. The goal here is to triangulate the findings from the two forms of data. Triangulation of the two sets of findings serves to validate both the qualitative and quantitative findings (if the results from two methods agree), or to generate insights in need of further research (if the results from two methods disagree).     

There are two types of convergent mixed methods designs:

* Qual-Quant:  Primarily a qualitative study that uses quantitative data to supplement or validate the qualitative findings.
* Quant-Qual: Primarily a quantitative study that uses qualitative data to supplement or validate the quantitative findings.
