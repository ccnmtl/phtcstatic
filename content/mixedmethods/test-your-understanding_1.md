<div class="answer-container item-feedback" id="answer01a">
<i>Correct:</i> Qualitative methods are weak in their ability to assess prevalence.  This is a strength of quantitative methods .
</div>
<div class="answer-container item-feedback" id="answer01b">
<i>Incorrect:</i> The unstructured and open-ended nature of qualitative methods are ideal for identifying new and unanticipated findings.
</div>
<div class="answer-container item-feedback" id="answer01c">
<i>Incorrect:</i> Because qualitative methods allow participants to explain their behavior from their own perspective, qualitative methods are ideal for obtaining the views and voices of participants themselves.
</div>
<div class="answer-container item-feedback" id="answer01d">
<i>Incorrect:</i> This is a strength of qualitative methods.  Unlike quantitative methods where situational factors must be anticipated by the researcher, in qualitative methods participants can suggest specific [and unanticipated] situational or contextual factors which may facilitate or limit their behavior.
