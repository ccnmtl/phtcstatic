<div class="mixedmethod"><div class="pageblock"><p>When used alone, qualitative and quantitative research designs have inherent strengths and limitations.  In contrast, by combining qualitative and quantitative methods, mixed methods research can integrate the strengths of both approaches.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Compensates for the Weaknesses of Mono-Method Studies</strong>: Mixed methods research provides strengths which compensate for the weaknesses of either qualitative or quantitative research alone (mono-method studies).  For example, quantitative research is often weak in understanding the context or settings of behavior, allowing participants own voices and perspectives to be heard, or obtaining new insights.  By integrating a qualitative component, a mixed methods study offers a way to address these weaknesses.  Conversely, qualitative research can be weak in that the interpretation of text can be idiosyncratic or subjective, the findings cannot be quantified, and cannot always be generalized due to the small sample.  By integrating a quantitative component, a mixed methods study offers a way to address the weaknesses of a qualitative study alone.</p>

<p><strong>Provides more Data for Understanding the Phenomenon</strong>: By collecting data with two separate methodologies, a mixed methods study provides more evidence for understanding the phenomenon than a single method study.  In this respect, mixed methods are pragmatic in that it gives the researcher greater opportunity to understand the phenomenon. For example, if a qualitative finding emerges, a mixed methods study will often provide quantitative data to further validate that finding.  Conversely, if an unanticipated quantitative finding emerges, a mixed methods study will provide qualitative data to potentially understand the reason for that association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Addresses a Broader Set of Research Questions</strong>: Mixed methods studies can address a broader set of research questions than a single method study.  Whereas a quantitative study may be restricted to the prevalence and association among variables assessed by the researcher, a mixed methods study will provide the opportunity for also answering questions about the context of the phenomenon and the participants’ experience and motives for the phenomenon.  Conversely, whereas a qualitative study may be restricted to answering questions about participants’ experiences, motives, and understandings of a phenomenon, a mixed methods study can also offer the opportunity to answer questions about the prevalence of a phenomenon, the statistical associations between predictors and outcomes, and the strength or degree to which this factor may be important to understanding the phenomenon.  </p>
