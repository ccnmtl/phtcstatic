<div class="mixedmethod"><div class="pageblock"><p>In mixed methods studies, qualitative data is often analyzed using traditional qualitative techniques and quantitative data in mixed methods are often analyzed separately using traditional quantitative techniques. However, the diversity of mixed methods designs and the multiple types of data collected in mixed methods research often requires innovative ways of analyzing and integrating the data.  </p>
<p>In the next section, we will go over the 7 most common methods of analyzing mixed methods data.  </p>
