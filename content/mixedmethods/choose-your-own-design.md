                        Based on the focus
                        groups, students reported that smokeless tobacco
                        was viewed as a masculine, adult thing to do and
                        that it was particularly popular among students
                        involved in the school's athletics program.
                        Students report that older athletes encourage
                        younger athletes to use smokeless tobacco.
                        Finally, those who use smokeless tobacco are
                        aware of the risks, but do not feel that such
                        health problems will affect them unless they use
                        tobacco for decades.

                        Excellent! This Qualitative followed by Quantitative
                        design is an example of an Exploratory Mixed Methods
                        Design. Building on the insights from the qualitative
                        data, your survey was able to determine that indeed
                        smokeless tobacco use was significantly more common
                        among athletes than non-athletes. You also were able to

                        more likely to use smokeless tobacco. Now, you have a
                        strong basis for designing intervention programs;
                        including what students should be targeted and what
                        skills (peer pressure resistance) should be targeted for
                        the intervention to have maximum efficacy.

                        on what factors contribute to smokeless tobacco use or

                        Based on the focus groups, students reported that
                        smokeless tobacco was viewed as a masculine, adult thing
                        to do and that it was particularly popular among
                        students involved in the school's athletics program.
                        Students report that older athletes encourage younger
                        athletes to use smokeless tobacco. Finally, those who
                        use smokeless tobacco are aware of the risks, but do not
                        feel that they such health problems will affect them
                        unless they use tobacco for decades. This explains why
                        your first program to increase perceived risk did not
                        change behavior. However, it is still unclear how many
                        students and how many student athletes use smokeless
                        tobacco, and whether these insights from the focus
                        groups are indeed significantly associated with
                        smokeless tobacco use.
