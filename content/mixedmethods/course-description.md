The following course is designed to provide the learner with an introduction to the benefits of mixed methods, different mixed methods research designs, and methods of analyzing and integrating mixed methods data.  

## Who should take this course?

This course is designed for individuals who have a background in designing or implementing either qualitative or quantitative research (or both) and who would like to expand their work to include mixed methods research.  The course is ideal for those with a Masterâ€™s in public health or another social/behavioral or health science discipline or who have equivalent experience in the design or conduct of qualitative or quantitative research.

* The design, conduct, and goals of quantitative research in public health (for example, designing or conducting epidemiological survey research)
* Traditional statistical analysis techniques for the analysis of quantitative data
* The design, conduct, and goals of qualitative research in public health (for example, designing or conducting focus groups or in-depth interviews)
* Traditional techniques for the analysis of qualitative data (for example, qualitative content analysis through coding of textual data)

For those without this background knowledge, it is recommended that you complete the following trainings before beginning this course:
