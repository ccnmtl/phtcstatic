* Traditional statistical analysis techniques for the analysis of quantitative data
* The design, conduct, and goals of qualitative research in public health (for example, designing or conducting focus groups or in-depth interviews)
* Traditional techniques for the analysis of qualitative data (for example, qualitative content analysis through coding of textual data)
