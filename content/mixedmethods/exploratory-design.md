Exploratory mixed methods designs are a type of sequential mixed methods design in which traditional qualitative methods are used to inform a subsequent quantitative study.  Specifically, qualitative data are gathered first with the goal of generating insights which are used to inform the content and design of the quantitative survey or intervention. Because exploratory designs use qualitative followed by quantitative methods, they are also commonly referred to as a Qual-Quant design.
