There are many different mixed method study designs and researchers often use different terms to refer to these designs.  Mixed methods research designs can be classified into two categories based on whether the qualitative and quantitative data are gathered concurrently or sequentially.    

In sequential mixed methods designs, the data are first collected using one method, followed by the second method (e.g., qualitative then quantitative).  Analysis of the data from the first method precedes design or execution of data collection in the second method.  Examples of sequential mixed methods designs include:

* Exploratory mixed methods design
* Explanatory mixed methods design

In concurrent mixed methods designs, the quantitative and qualitative data are gathered during the same time period, often from the same individuals/participants. Examples of sequential mixed methods designs include:

* Convergent mixed methods design
* Embedded or nested mixed methods design

Finally, a series of sequential and/or concurrent designs can be combined to form what is commonly referred to as:

* Multiphase or iterative mixed methods design

In the next section, we outline the 5 mixed methods research designs listed above.
