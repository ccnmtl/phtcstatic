With explanatory mixed methods design, quantitative data are gathered first and are the priority. The quantitative data are analyzed using traditional statistical techniques. The findings from the quantitative analysis will then inform the design of the subsequent qualitative data collection. The qualitative data are gathered and analyzed using traditional qualitative techniques, with the goal of explaining and/or providing insight into earlier quantitative findings.

Embedded design uses a similar approach to data analysis as explanatory design, except the data are collected concurrently. In embedded design, the findings of one are not informing the _design_ of the other. However, the findings of one might inform or explain the _findings_ of the other.
