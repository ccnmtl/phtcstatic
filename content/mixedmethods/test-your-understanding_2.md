<i>Incorrect:</i> Exploratory mixed methods are a type of mixed methods design in which qualitative data are gathered first with the goal of generating insights that are used to inform the content and design of subsequent quantitative research.

<i>Correct:</i> Explanatory mixed methods designs are a type of mixed methods design in which quantitative data are collected and analyzed prior to the collection and analysis of qualitative data. Qualitative data are gathered to explain earlier quantitative findings.
