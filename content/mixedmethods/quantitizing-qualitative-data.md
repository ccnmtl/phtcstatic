<div class="mixedmethod"><div class="pageblock"><p>A final method of integrating qualitative and quantitative data in mixed methods studies is by way of “quantitizing” the qualitative data (Sandelowski, Voils, and Knafl, 2009).  Quantitizing is a method of converting qualitative data into quantitative data by assigning numerical values to qualitative data. </p>
<p>Specifically, after qualitative coding and analysis is complete, numerical values can be assigned to the qualitative themes. Often, this is done with 1 representing that a participant discussed or mentioned a particular theme, and 0 representing that they did not.  Thus, these new quantitized data can be incorporated into the quantitative data for analysis using traditional quantitative techniques.</p>
<p>For example, if a qualitative theme is identified about stress contributing to cigarette smoking, a variable can be created to represent the presence or absence of this theme. Then, this variable can be examined as a potential predictor variable of the number of cigarettes smoked, to determine if this (formerly) qualitative variable is statistically associated with smoking (as suggested by the participants).  This too offers evidence of validity between the qualitative reports and statistical outcomes.  </p>
