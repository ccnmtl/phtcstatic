<div class="programevaluation"><div class="pageblock"><p>We have started drafting our evaluation plan, and although it’s still missing some sections, let’s look at what we have so far. Once the plan is completed it will have nine sections:</p>
</div><div class="pageblock well">
<div class="pullquote"><ol>
<li>Purpose of Evaluation</li>
<li>Project Setting and Stakeholders</li>
<li>Project Intervention</li>
<li>Logic Model</li>
<li>Evaluation Questions</li>
<li>Evaluation Design</li>
<li>Data Analysis Plan</li>
<li>Limitations and Feasibility</li>
<li>Dissemination Plan</li>
</ol></div>
</div><div class="pageblock"><p>Although there is no standard way of organizing an evaluation plan, these nine areas are typically addressed in an evaluation proposal or plan. We'll begin by reviewing the sections of the plan we've already completed: Project Setting and Stakeholders, Project Intervention, Logic Model, Evaluation Questions, and Purpose of Evaluation; and we'll see how these sections correspond to the steps of the CDC Framework.</p>
