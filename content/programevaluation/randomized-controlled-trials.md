</div><div class="pageblock"><p>Letâ€™s start with the most rigorous option and consider
    whether a randomized design with a control group is possible for our study. In
    such a design, there must be a way to randomly assign a pool of participants into
    two groups. One of the groups will then be exposed to the intervention, in our
    case, the ShapeTracker. If we find a difference between the groups, we can be
    fairly certain that the difference was caused by our intervention, and not by
    some other difference between the two groups.</p>
<p>You may have seen the following notation used to specify the
    components of a randomized design:</p>
</div><div class="pageblock well">
<div class="pullquote"><p align="center"><strong>R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O</p>

<p><p align="center">R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O</strong></p></p></div>
</div><div class="pageblock"><p>The two rows represent the two groups. The Rs indicate that the groups are randomly assigned. The Os indicate when outcomes are measured. In this case, both groups provide a baseline measure and a post-test. Note that only the first group has an X, which means that they are exposed to the intervention.</p>
</div><div class="pageblock"><p>Is it possible to have randomly assigned groups in our ShapeTracker evaluation? Do you think the following would give us a randomized controlled design?</p>

<i>The correct answer is A:</i>
</p><p>This would give us randomly assigned groups. A systematic method of random assignment is defined. However, this plan may not be feasible if we think people will resent being waitlisted. Also, we would have to consider if “contamination” of the control group is possible. For example, maybe those with access to ShapeTracker will share some of the benefits with the control group members who might be their family members of neighbors.</p>
