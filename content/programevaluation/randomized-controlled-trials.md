Let’s start with the most rigorous option and consider whether a randomized design with a control group is possible for our study. In such a design, there must be a way to randomly assign a pool of participants into two groups. One of the groups will then be exposed to the intervention, in our case, the ShapeTracker. If we find a difference between the groups, we can be fairly certain that the difference was caused by our intervention, and not by some other difference between the two groups.

You may have seen the following notation used to specify the components of a randomized design:

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center randomized-notation">
    <div class="cell">
        R
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
        O
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
        X
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
        O
    </div>
</div>
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center randomized-notation mb-3">
    <div class="cell">
        R
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
        O
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
        &nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
        O
    </div>
</div>

The two rows represent the two groups. The Rs indicate that the groups are randomly assigned. The Os indicate when outcomes are measured. In this case, both groups provide a baseline measure and a post-test. Note that only the first group has an X, which means that they are exposed to the intervention.

Is it possible to have randomly assigned groups in our ShapeTracker evaluation? For the questions below, determine if the following scenarios would give us a randomized controlled design by selecting “Yes” or “No.”

There is no randomized assignment. Note that random selection is about sampling and does not mean random assignment. But the group of non-users in eastern Middleton could be a comparison group in a quasi-experimental design.

Again, there is no randomized assignment because there is no control group. But those who report not using ShapeTracker could be defined as a comparison group, especially if we try to control for sociodemographic and other group characteristics in the statistical analysis.

This would give us randomly assigned groups. A systematic method of random assignment is defined. However, this plan may not be feasible if we think people will resent being waitlisted. Also, we would have to consider if “contamination” of the control group is possible. For example, maybe those with access to ShapeTracker will share some of the benefits with the control group members who might be their family members of neighbors.
