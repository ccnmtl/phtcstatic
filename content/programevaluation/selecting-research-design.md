</div><div class="pageblock"><p>The primary outcome evaluation question we have chosen to address is:</p>
</div><div class="pageblock well">
<div class="pullquote"><p>Does the use of ShapeTracker increase healthy eating and physical activity among county residents?</p></div>
</div><div class="pageblock"><p>We would also like to include two other questions about short-term outcomes:</p>
</div><div class="pageblock well">
<div class="pullquote"><p><ol>
    <li>Does use of ShapeTracker increase self-monitoring for healthy eating and physical activity?</li>
    <li>Does ShapeTracker decrease perceived barriers to healthy eating and physical activity?</li>
  </ol></p></div>
</div><div class="pageblock"><p>Let’s keep these questions in mind as we review different research designs for outcome evaluation.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of research designs to choose from. They range from the “gold standard” experimental design of randomized controlled trial to many kinds of quasi-experimental and descriptive designs. Some designs include comparison groups (not randomly assigned), and others might do pre and post-tests with just one group. Generally, we want to aim for the most rigorous research design that is possible the given the time, resources and data available. </p>
<p>Every situation presents with different constraints. For example, sometimes there is no way to randomly assign participants into intervention and control groups. Other times, the intervention has started already, and baseline measures cannot be collected. And in some cases, there are no suitable comparison groups, or the evaluation budget may only allow pre and post-tests on one group.</p>
