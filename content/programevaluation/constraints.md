<div class="pageblock"><h3>Budget, Time, Data and Political Constraints</h3>
</div><div class="pageblock well">
<div class="pullquote"><p>Most evaluations are conducted in environments with serious constraints for budget, time, data and politics (Bamberger, Rugh &amp; Mabry, 2006).</p></div>
</div><div class="pageblock"><p>This means that evaluators are constrained by:</p>
<ul>
<li> Timelines and time pressures</li>
<li> Limited budgets and resources</li>
<li> Not having control group, comparison group
      and/or baseline data available</li>
<li>Challenging expectations from stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some general strategies for addressing these
    constraints suggested by Bamberger and colleagues. Note that some of them will
    increase threats to scientific validity of the evaluation.</p>

<p>For example, if the ShapeTracker evaluation team had severe
    time and/or budget constraints, the only feasible design might be a pre-post
    assessment of Shape-Tracker users in Middleton county. This would represent a
    serious trade-off of scientific rigor over the comparison group design we
    selected above, limiting the validity of the findings.</p>
</div><div class="pageblock"><div class="cases">
<p>Letâ€™s say the Commissioner is questioning the comparison group design we selected, saying that it will be too expensive and take too long to complete. </p>
<p>What would you do and why? </p>

<p>How would you adjust the evaluation plan? - or -</p>

<p></p><p><strong>Depending on how strong the pressure from the Commissioner is, you may have to adjust the evaluation plan. There are many ways of simplifying the design, such as a one-group pre-post design with ShapeTracker users only.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But you may want to remind the Commissioner of the reasons why a strong evaluation of ShapeTracker is needed. Many other stakeholders may question the investment in ShapeTracker, and the Commissioner will need rigorous evaluation data to back it up. You may also need to argue that pre-post data from one group has limited validity because a change in an outcome cannot be attributed to the intervention.</strong></p>
