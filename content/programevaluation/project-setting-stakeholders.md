Letâ€™s start with Project Setting and Stakeholders. The project setting section would include descriptions of Middleton County and some of those statistics we reviewed earlier, and as the CDC Framework suggests, it is important to engage stakeholders in the evaluation process.

Representatives of our key stakeholders have been invited to be on an advisory group that helps to guide our evaluation. The advisory group meets periodically by conference call, and will play an active roll in our decision-making going forward.

Here is the list of stakeholders we brainstormed.
