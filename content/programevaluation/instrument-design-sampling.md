## Instrument Design

Design of the data collection instruments, whether they are surveys, interview questions, or something else, is often a big evaluation task. Stakeholder input is very important and helpful during instrument design.

## Sampling

Evaluators also need to define their sampling strategies and sample size requirements. For our primary outcome evaluation design, we are lucky to have access to county-wide household surveys that are designed to reach representative samples of county residents.

Major types of sampling strategies include:

        Random sample that ensures representative samples of subgroups (strata) within the overall sample. For example, an ethnic minority group may be oversampled to obtain a representative subsample.

        Clusters of units are randomly selected. Clusters may be, for example, schools or census tracts. For example, if the county has 20 elementary schools, 5 of the 20 would be randomly selected to represent all students in the county.

        Participants provide referrals to other potential participants. This is useful, for example, when recruiting hard-to-reach populations or experts on a topic.

A power analysis can be conducted to calculate a required sample size for an evaluation. Many tools are available for sample size calculations, although they require some understanding of the principles of statistical inference. This is an area where many evaluators reach out to biostatisticians for help.

A final note about the Evaluation Design section: It is also important to have clear written protocols for data collection activities. These may need to be separate documents outside of the Evaluation Plan. They will list all steps that need to be carried out with each data collection activity, including instructions for recruitment and informed consent.

Now, let’s review what we have just discussed about indicators, data collection methods and sampling.

<i>The correct answer is D:</i><br />Program evaluation is applied social science research and evaluators should consider the full range of social science research methods when designing evaluation. There are many potential data collection methods that could be used to answer any given evaluation question. Design of data collection instruments is typically a challenging and time-consuming task. Among sampling strategies, the most rigorous is called simple random sampling, which means that every unit has an equal probability of being selected.
