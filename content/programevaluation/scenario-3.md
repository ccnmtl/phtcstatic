<div class="pageblock"><p>Here is another example for you to record using the notation system.</p>
<p>Middleton county has 12 census tracts. Four are urban, four are suburban and four are rural. We will randomly assign half of the census tracts to the intervention. Residents living in the selected tracts will be invited to participate in the ShapeTracker program. Residents from other tracts will be told that ShapeTracker will be available to them in 2 years. In addition to email surveys of ShapeTracker users, a county-wide survey including measures of physical activity, healthy eating and self-monitoring will be conducted before ShapeTracker launch and 12 months after the launch.</p>
<p>Please use the notation system to depict the evaluation design.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Click on a gray space to enter a value, then click on a notation of your selection. You can change your notation by clicking on the space again.  <strong>Note that all the gray spaces must be filled, so to leave a space blank you must select the blank space notation. </strong></p>

<p>You've not begun your notation exercise. Please try again.</p>

<div class="notation_undetermined">
<p>You are not done with your notation. Please note that all the gray spaces must be filled, and that a blank space is considered a notation.</p>

<div class="notation_correct">
<p>That's the correct answer. Congratulations!</p>
</div>
<div class="notation_incorrect">
<p>Your notation is incorrect.  You can <span id="show_answerkey_grid">see the answer key</span> or change your notation.</p>
<div class="notation_answerkey">
<p><b>Answer key:</b></p>
<p>The correct notation is:</p>
<div class="answerkeybox">
<div class="answerkeyrow">
<div class="answerkey_cell">R</div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">O</div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">X</div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">O</div>
</div>
<div class="answerkeyrow">
<div class="answerkey_cell">R</div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">O</div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">Â </div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">O</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can hover your cursor over the notation to see the corresponding grid in the exercise.</p>
<p>We have two rows because two groups based on census tracts are compared. We need an <b>R</b> because there is random assignment. This kind of design is called <i>cluster-randomized design</i> because clusters (census tracts) are randomly assigned</p>
