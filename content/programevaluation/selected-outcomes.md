Let’s take a look at the evaluation questions and logic model again to find the outcomes we decided to focus on. These are the outcomes we will need to measure in the survey items.

Earlier, we located one of the outcomes—self-monitoring of healthy eating and physical activity—in the short-term outcome column. The corresponding evaluation question is: “Does use of ShapeTracker increase self-monitoring of healthy eating and physical activity?”

Our primary outcome evaluation question is: “Does use of ShapeTracker increase healthy eating and physical activity among county residents?” In light of our newly defined research design, we should specify:

“Do residents of Middleton county who use ShapeTracker increase healthy eating and physical activity, compared to residents of Upperton county with no access to ShapeTracker?”

<i>The correct answer is C:</i><br />These are the two outcomes we specify in the question. We do ultimately want to have an impact on the long-term outcomes of obesity and related health problems but this evaluation question focuses on the intermediate outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating.
