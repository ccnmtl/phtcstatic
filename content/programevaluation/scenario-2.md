<div class="pageblock"><p>Now I want you to use the notation system for the second example.</p>
<p>The team is considering the following design: When Middleton county residents request their ShapeTracker user ID online, they are asked to fill out an online survey. They will be required to provide a valid email as part of the registration. We will use those email addresses to send another brief survey to everyone six months after registration to measure our outcomes. A gift card raffle is offered as incentive to survey respondents.</p>
<p>Please use the notation system to depict the evaluation design.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Click on a gray space to enter a value, then click on a notation of your selection. You can change your notation by clicking on the space again.  <strong>Note that all the gray spaces must be filled, so to leave a space blank you must select the blank space notation. </strong></p>
</div>

<div class="no_entry">
<p>You've not begun your notation exercise. Please try again.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation_undetermined">
<p>You are not done with your notation. Please note that all the gray spaces must be filled, and that a blank space is considered a notation.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation_correct">
<p>That's the correct answer. Congratulations!</p>
</div>
<div class="notation_incorrect">
<p>Your notation is incorrect.  You can <span id="show_answerkey_grid">see the answer key</span> or change your notation.</p>
<div class="notation_answerkey">
<p><b>Answer key:</b></p>
<p>The correct notation is:</p>
<div class="answerkeybox">
<div class="answerkeyrow">
<div class="answerkey_cell"> </div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">O</div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">X</div>
<div class="answerkey_cell">O</div>
</div>
<div class="answerkeyrow">
<div class="answerkey_cell"> </div>
<div class="answerkey_cell"> </div>
<div class="answerkey_cell"> </div>
<div class="answerkey_cell"> </div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can hover your cursor over the notation to see the corresponding grid in the exercise.</p>
<p>This design has no control or comparison group. We only need one row. Only one group (ShapeTraker users) is followed up over time. This is a pre-post design.</p>
