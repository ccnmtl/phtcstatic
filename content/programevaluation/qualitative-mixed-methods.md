<div class="pageblock clearfix"><h3>A Note about
    Qualitative and Mixed Methods</h3>
<p>Outcome evaluation research typically uses quantitative
    methods, as is the case with our examples so far. Qualitative and mixed methods
    are mostly used in process evaluation, but they can also be useful in outcome
    evaluation. </p>
<p>For example, letâ€™s consider our evaluation question whether
    ShapeTracker decreases perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy
    eating. We may not have a clear idea of what specific barriers are important in
    our community and how ShapeTracker can address them. Qualitative methods may be
    well justified for this evaluation question. </p>
<p>An example of evaluation design would be focus groups with
    ShapeTracker users to discuss challenges to exercising and eating healthy and how
    ShapeTracker has helped them. Systematic qualitative analysis can be used to
    provide evidence of program effectiveness.</p>
<h3>How do we choose
    among the many options for research design?</h3>
<p>There are many factors to consider. Choosing a design is
    always a matter of finding the right balance of scientific rigor and
    feasibility. We will come back to specific threats to validity and feasibility
    considerations when we discuss the Limitations and Feasibility section of the
    Evaluation Plan.</p>
<p>It is also important to work with the stakeholders as we
    make decisions about the evaluation design. Please click on the stakeholder
    icon to remind yourself who is in our stakeholder advisory group.</p>
<p>And remember that the logic model and evaluation questions
    can help us stay focused as we discuss design options.</p>
