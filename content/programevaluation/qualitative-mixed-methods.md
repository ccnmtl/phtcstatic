## A Note about Qualitative and Mixed Methods

Outcome evaluation research typically uses quantitative methods, as is the case with our examples so far. Qualitative and mixed methods are mostly used in process evaluation, but they can also be useful in outcome evaluation.

For example, letâ€™s consider our evaluation question whether ShapeTracker decreases perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating. We may not have a clear idea of what specific barriers are important in our community and how ShapeTracker can address them. Qualitative methods may be well justified for this evaluation question.

An example of evaluation design would be focus groups with ShapeTracker users to discuss challenges to exercising and eating healthy and how ShapeTracker has helped them. Systematic qualitative analysis can be used to provide evidence of program effectiveness.

## How do we choose among the many options for research design?

There are many factors to consider. Choosing a design is always a matter of finding the right balance of scientific rigor and feasibility. We will come back to specific threats to validity and feasibility considerations when we discuss the Limitations and Feasibility section of the Evaluation Plan.

It is also important to work with the stakeholders as we make decisions about the evaluation design. Please click on the stakeholder icon to remind yourself who is in our stakeholder advisory group.

And remember that the logic model and evaluation questions can help us stay focused as we discuss design options.
