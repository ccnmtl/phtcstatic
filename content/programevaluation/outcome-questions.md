</div><div class="pageblock"><p>Now letâ€™s look at our list of outcome evaluation questions more closely and see if it needs to be revised.</p>
</div><div class="pageblock well">
<div class="pullquote"><ol>
    <li>Does use of ST increase:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>self-monitoring of healthy eating and physical activity?</li>
        <li>self-efficacy for healthy eating and physical activity?</li>
        <li>social support for healthy eating and physical activity?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Does ST decrease perceived barriers to healthy eating and physical activity?</li>
    <li>Does use of ST increase healthy eating and physical activity among county residents?</li>
    <li>Does use of ST lead to lower BMI among those who are obese or overweight?</li>
    <li>Does use of ST help those with normal BMI prevent overweight?</li>
  </ol></div>
</div><div class="pageblock"><p>This is an ambitious list of questions, even for a rigorous evaluation plan. As is often the case, it is probably more feasible to assess intermediate outcomes than long-term outcomes. We should probably drop the questions involving BMI.</p>
<p>I think that will be acceptable because showing that ShapeTracker has an impact on diet and physical activity will be great evidence of its effectiveness. That narrows the list leaving us with the following outcome questions:</p>
