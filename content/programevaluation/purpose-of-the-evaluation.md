We are making good progress with our plan. So far we have completed the following sections:

* Project setting & Stakeholders
* Project intervention
* Logic model
* Evaluation questions

At this point we are ready to draft the __Purpose of the Evaluation__. It is very useful to articulate the purpose in words, as it will to focus your thinking. This is also another opportunity to engage your stakeholders. You can work with them to create a statement that reflects a common understanding of the purpose of the evaluation. Here is our statement of purpose:

  <div class="card-body">
  The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the ShapeTracker program in Middleton County. The evaluation will measure the success of ShapeTracker implementation, as well as selected program outcomes, including ShapeTrackerâ€™s impact on healthy eating and physical activity among county residents. The evaluation will inform decision-makers regarding continuation of ShapeTracker and contribute to the evidence regarding smart-phone apps in community-based obesity prevention.
