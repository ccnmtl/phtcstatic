<ul>
<li>Project setting & Stakeholders</li>
<li>Project intervention</li>
<li>Logic model</li>
<li>Evaluation questions</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Evaluation Design</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will review some scientific and practical considerations in evaluation planning. These are the kinds of issues that we can discuss in the Limitations and Feasibility section, which is the last section of the Evaluation Plan we will cover today.</p>
<p>You have probably heard the technical terminology of validity used in discussions about research designs. To be precise, validity is about how true or correct the inferences are that you can make based on your design. Things like adequate sample size and randomized control group will increase the validity of your design.</p>

<tr>
<th class="th1" valign="top">Threats to internal validity:
      </th><td><ul>
<li>Selection: Systematic differences between groups that could also impact the outcomes. Randomization   addresses selection bias.</li>
<li>History: Events occurring concurrently with intervention. Serious threat in pre-post   designs.</li>
<li>Maturation: Naturally occurring changes over time. Serious threat in pre-post designs.</li>
<li>Attrition: Loss of respondents during study that biases results.</li>
<li>Testing: Exposure to a measure can affect scores on subsequent exposures to the same   measure.</li>
</ul></td>
