You have probably heard the technical terminology of validity used in discussions about research designs. To be precise, validity is about how true or correct the inferences are that you can make based on your design. Things like adequate sample size and randomized control group will increase the validity of your design.

Following is a list of common types of validity and associated threats. Note that this list is not exhaustive. Please refer to
[Shadish, Cook & Campbell, 2002](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9453/f229a8f51f6a95232e42acfae9b3ae5345df.pdf)
for a comprehensive list and discussion.

    Threats to internal validity:

    <div class="col-12 col-md-9 py-2">
    <ul class="pl-3 m-0">
	<li>Selection: Systematic differences between groups that could also impact the outcomes. Randomization addresses selection bias.</li>
	<li>History: Events occurring concurrently with intervention. Serious threat in pre-post designs.</li>
	<li>Maturation: Naturally occurring changes over time. Serious threat in pre-post designs.</li>
	<li>Attrition: Loss of respondents during study that biases results.</li>
	<li>Testing: Exposure to a measure can affect scores on subsequent exposures to the same measure.</li>
