Next on our list is the logic model. We have put together a Logic Model that outlines how we think the ShapeTracker app ultimately leads to a lower burden of obesity-related illness in our community. This is also part of Step 2 of the CDC Framework.

We worked closely with stakeholders to get input on the logic model.  Watch this short video, which describes our logic model.
