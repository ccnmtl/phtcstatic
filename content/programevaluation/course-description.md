<div class="programevaluation"><div class="pageblock"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Learners will take on the role of a staff member at the Middleton County Health Department who is tasked with helping to develop an evaluation plan for an obesity-prevention program recently launched in Middleton County. Using the CDC Program Evaluation Framework, learners will connect each step of the framework with a section of the evaluation plan, going into detailed discussion about: selecting and incorporating stakeholders in the evaluation process, developing relevant evaluation questions, designing an evaluation study and using standard notation, choosing a sampling strategy, and thinking through limitations and threats to validity. Additionally, the learner will review strategies for conducting rigorous evaluations within constraints of budget, time, and resources.</p>
