## Overview

Learners will take on the role of a staff member at the Middleton County Health Department who is tasked with helping to develop an evaluation plan for an obesity-prevention program recently launched in Middleton County. Using the CDC Program Evaluation Framework, learners will connect each step of the framework with a section of the evaluation plan, going into detailed discussion about: selecting and incorporating stakeholders in the evaluation process, developing relevant evaluation questions, designing an evaluation study and using standard notation, choosing a sampling strategy, and thinking through limitations and threats to validity. Additionally, the learner will review strategies for conducting rigorous evaluations within constraints of budget, time, and resources.

Advanced Program Evaluation builds on the knowledge and skills obtained from the Program Evaluation training series. See “Prerequisites” for additional information.
