That concludes the Evaluation Design section of the Evaluation Plan. We are almost at the end. So far we have completed the following sections:

* Project setting & Stakeholders
* Project intervention
* Logic model
* Evaluation questions
* Purpose
* Evaluation Design

Now we will review some scientific and practical considerations in evaluation planning. These are the kinds of issues that we can discuss in the Limitations and Feasibility section, which is the last section of the Evaluation Plan we will cover today.
