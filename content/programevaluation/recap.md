    today. To recap, here are the sections again:</p>
<ol>
<li>  Purpose of Evaluation</li>
<li>  Project Setting and Stakeholders</li>
<li>  Project Intervention</li>
<li>Logic Model</li>
<li>Evaluation Questions</li>
<li>Evaluation Design</li>
<li> Data Analysis Plan</li>
<li> Limitations and Feasibility</li>
<li> Dissemination Plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of what we discussed today focused on the design for
    outcome evaluation (in Section 6), which is the “centerpiece” of the evaluation
    plan. But as we saw, all other sections of the plan relate to the evaluation
    design. It is especially important to keep in mind that throughout the
    evaluation planning process you revisited the Stakeholders, Logic Model and Evaluation Questions.</p>
<p>The sections of the plan roughly correspond with steps in
    the CDC Program Evaluation Framework:</p>
<table>

<th class="th1">Evaluation Plan
          Section</th>

      Framework</th>

<p>That concludes our session today. Thanks for helping the
    ShapeTracker team work on their evaluation plan and figure out their evaluation
    design! Good luck with your own evaluation projects!</p>
