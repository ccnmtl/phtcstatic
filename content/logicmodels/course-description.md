## Overview

This module expands on the knowledge and skills learned in “[Introduction to Logic Models](http://www.phtc-online.org/catalog/LM/).” In this training program, participants will build a logic model based on a scenarios related to improving access to healthy food in underserved neighborhoods. Participants will be asked to create a logic model based on components in the scenario and will be able to compare their logic model to an expert logic model.

## Learning objectives
Upon completion of this program, students should be able to: 

* Construct a public health program logic model based on given program information

## Who should take this course?

This program is ideal for those interested in practicing and enhancing logic model building skills, as a part of designing and/or evaluating a program.

## Prerequisites

Through prior training or experience, participants are expected to have some background knowledge on logic models and program development and evaluation. For those without this background, it is recommended that you complete the following training before beginning this program:

* [Introduction to Logic Models](http://www.phtc-online.org/catalog/LM/)
* [Program Development & Evaluation](http://www.phtc-online.org/catalog/PE/)
* [Evaluating a Public Health Program](http://www.phtc-online.org/catalog/ev/)

## Estimated time to complete

10–30 minutes, depending on the number of scenarios completed.

## Continuing Education credits

0.5 CPH credit. The New York City-Long Island-Lower Tri-County Public Health Training Center is a NBPHE pre-approved provider of CPH continuing education credits. 0.5 CPH CE will be awarded for participation in this activity.

## Revision

This course has been revised as of August 31st, 2017 to incorporate scenarios related to food policy and social determinants of health and to improve the interactive components of the logic model activity.
