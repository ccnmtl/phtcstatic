<div class="logicmodels"><div class="pageblock"><h3>Overview</h3><p>This module expands on the knowledge and skills learned in “<a href="http://www.phtc-online.org/catalog/LM/" target="_blank">Introduction to Logic Models</a>.” In this training program, participants will build a logic model based on a scenarios related to improving access to healthy food in underserved neighborhoods. Participants will be asked to create a logic model based on components in the scenario and will be able to compare their logic model to an expert logic model.</p>
</div><div class="pageblock"><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>Upon completion of this program, students should be able to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Construct a public health program logic model based on given program information</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="pageblock"><h3>Who should take this course?</h3><p>This program is ideal for those interested in practicing and enhancing logic model building skills, as a part of designing and/or evaluating a program.</p>
</div><div class="pageblock"><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>Through prior training or experience, participants are expected to have some background knowledge on logic models and program development and evaluation. For those without this background, it is recommended that you complete the following training before beginning this program:</p>
