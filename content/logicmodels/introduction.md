<div class="logicmodels"><div class="pageblock"><p>A well-constructed logic model is the backbone of good program planning, management, and evaluation. Logic models are visual tools that depict a sequence of events that is expected to create a change or address a specific problem or issue. Creating a logic model requires systematic thinking and planning in order to best describe a program and show the logical relationship between the need being addressed, the services being provided to address the need, and the changes expected as a result of the services provided. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation states in its Logic Model Development Guide that, “effective evaluation and program success rely on the fundamentals of clear stakeholder assumptions and expectations about how and why a program will solve a particular problem, generate new possibilities, and make the most of valuable assets. The logic model approach helps create shared understanding of and focus on program goals and methodology, relating activities to projected outcomes,” (W. K. Kellogg Foundation, 2004).</p>
<p>With a detailed and comprehensive logic model in head, program planners and stakeholders are able to identify points of strength and/or weakness and make changes to the program planning in response to identified issues. The Logic Model Development Guide states that, “in a logic model, you can adjust approaches and change courses as program plans are developed. Ongoing assessment, review, and corrections can produce better program design and a system to strategically monitor, manage, and report program outcomes throughout development and implementation,” (W. K. Kellogg Foundation, 2004).</p>
