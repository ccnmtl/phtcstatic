<div class="logicmodels"><div class="pageblock"><p>There are different templates and formats for logic models which depict varying levels of complexity and detail. In public health, two often used logic model frameworks are the <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-contents/overview/other-models-promoting-community-health-and-development/preceder-proceder/main" target="_blank">PRECEDE-PROCEED Model</a> and <a href="https://interventionmapping.com/" target="_blank">Intervention Mapping</a>. For this training program, a simple six column template is used to demonstrate the overall logic, or thinking, behind the program design and the relationships between the components of a typical logic model and to help develop skills in how to create an accurate, comprehensive logic model.</p>
<p>For the simple six column logic model, program developers must identify six components of their program. These include:</p>
<ol class="custom-counter">
<li><i>Inputs</i> – resources that go into the program as the foundation for program activities; these are things like money, staff, and communication that are needed before the program starts,</li>
<li><i>Activities</i> – the planned events or actions of the program; these are the processes or services staff create and deliver to the intended population,</li>
<li><i>Outputs</i> – the direct products of activities that can be measured in countable terms such as the number of sessions held or number of people served,</li>
<li><i>Short-term outcomes</i> – changes that result from the program’s activities and outputs such as changes in knowledge, skills, behaviors, attitudes, status, and level of functioning; to identify short-term outcomes we can ask, “What can we expect to change if program participants are exposed to the intended amount of program activities and outputs?”</li>
<li><i>Intermediate outcomes</i> – changes that result from the program’s short-term outcomes such as changes in knowledge, skills, behaviors, attitudes, status, and level of functioning; to identify intermediate outcomes we can ask, “What can we expect to change if program participants achieve short-term outcomes?”</li>
<li><i>Long-term outcomes</i> – changes that result from the program’s short-term and intermediate outcomes such as changes in knowledge, skills, behaviors, attitudes, status, and level of functioning; to identify long-term outcomes we can ask, “What can we expect to change if program participants achieve short-term and intermediate outcomes?”</li>
