<div class="mixedmethod"><div class="pageblock"><p>Similar to above, mixed methods data can allow for the comparison of qualitative groups (or subgroups) using the quantitative data.  Specifically, analysis of the qualitative data may identify specific subgroups of interest (e.g., participants who report a specific theme or reason for a behavior).  Those who report this theme can then be compared to those who do not using the available quantitative data to understand if there are quantitative differences between these qualitative groups.</p>
<p>For example, a researcher can form groups using the qualitative data (e.g., individuals who do or do not report stress or emotional states as reasons for smoking).  Quantitative data can be used to examine if there are statistical differences between these two groups (e.g., do they differ on number of cigarettes smoked per day, or do they differ on a scale of life stress).</p>
