<div class="mixedmethod"><div class="pageblock"><p>Another way of integrating the qualitative and quantitative data is the comparison of quantitative groups (or subgroups) using the qualitative data. Often quantitative data are able to identity different groups (e.g., frequency of a health behavior) but not offer many insights on why some people engage in the behavior more than the other groups.  This “why” may be more effectively examined with the qualitative data.  Thus, the quantitative data are first used to identify particular subgroups (particular individuals who belong to each group).  These groups are then explored more fully with qualitative data to understand the reasons for being in that subgroup. </p>
<p>For example, a researcher can form groups based on a quantitatively assessed variable (e.g., heavy, light, and non-smokers). Qualitative data may provide insights into why these individuals differ on level of cigarette use.</p>
