<div class="mixedmethod"><div class="pageblock"><p>Another type of concurrent mixed methods design is commonly referred to as an embedded or nested design.  In an embedded mixed methods design, a small amount of either qualitative data or quantitative data are included within a larger qualitative or quantitative study.  For example, including open-ended questions to collect qualitative data in a larger quantitative survey is an example of an embedded mixed methods design.  Similarly, asking a small number of quantitative questions within an otherwise qualitative interview study would also be an example of an embedded mixed methods design.  </p>
