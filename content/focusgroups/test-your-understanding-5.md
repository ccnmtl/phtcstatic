<i>The correct answer is A:</i>
</p><p>Asking about her favorite initiative is open-ended, but very broad. Broad questions are better suited to the beginning of focus groups. Broad questions that get participants comfortable with the topic are often called engagement questions. Asking whether the kids liked the program might seem like a probing question, but it is dichotomous, meaning it can be answered with a simple yes or no. It is best to avoid yes/no questions because we want the participant to elaborate on their answer.</p>

<i>The correct answer is A:</i>
</p><p>The moderator should respectfully remind all participants of the time that is left so all participants feel like they can say what they need to before the focus group has ended. Although the focus group may be providing great information, the moderator must be mindful of participants’ time and make sure all responses are gathered in the time agreed upon by the participants.</p>
