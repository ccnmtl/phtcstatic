<i>The correct answer is C:</i>
</p><p>Explaining why participants were selected helps make each participant feel that they are welcome and have something valuable to contribute. </p>
<p>The moderator should set ground rules that only one person should talk at a time so everyone feels like they have a chance to be heard, and although participants can ask questions of the moderator, the moderator should stress that they want to hear from the participants and would prefer that the participants ask each other questions.</p>
