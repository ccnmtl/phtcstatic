<i>The correct answer is A:</i>
</p><p>In addition to eye contact, the moderator’s body language should signal that they are listening by leaning forward, nodding, and raising their eyebrows at interesting comments. The moderator should also acknowledge each participant's input by thanking them for their comments and saying they will talk more about those comments throughout the session.</p>
