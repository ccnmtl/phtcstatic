<div class="qualitativeresearch"><div class="pageblock"><p>Qualitative interviews can be thought of as “conversations with a purpose,” (Kahn and Cannell, 1957). These conversations can take place one-on-one between the researcher and study participant, known as an in-depth interview, or with a small group of study participants, known as a focus group. </p>
<h4>In-depth Interviews</h4>
<p>An in-depth interview is a meeting with an individual to discuss a particular topic. In-depth interviews are, perhaps, the most commonly known and widely employed of the qualitative data collection methods. While in-depth interviews can be conducted on any topic, it is an especially appropriate method for discussions about sensitive and/or complex issues, such as disease-related stigma or sexual preferences and practices. In-depth interviews can be open-ended, semi-structured, or unstructured. However it is designed, the purpose is to elicit rich information from the perspective of the interviewee.</p>
<h4>Focus Groups</h4>
<p>A focus group is an interview with a group of people where the goal is “to describe and understand perceptions, interpretation, and beliefs of a select population to gain understanding of a particular issue from the perspective of the group,” (Liamputtong 65). Researchers engage in focus group research when it is estimated that a group discussion on the topic of interest would richly contribute to the study and if there would be a benefit from group interaction. Group interaction is the unique feature of this method. The group dynamics of a focus group can encourage participant thought and engagement. Alternatively, “group think” – conformity to the responses of other participants in the focus group even if one does not agree – can stymie the process and discourage participants from sharing their true opinions and feelings.</p>
<p>Whether the researcher is conducting an in-depth interview or a focus group the purpose of both methods is to gather rich, detailed information from the study participants in order to understand his/her/their perspective on the particular issue or topic at hand. In interviews, the researcher should consider the participant to be the expert of his/her own experience, and as such their views are valuable and useful.</p>
