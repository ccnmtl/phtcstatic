Jonathan asks Maxine if, given the level of interaction with participants, special or specific ethical considerations exist for qualitative researchers. Maxine explains that maintaining strong ethics are essential to qualitative research, precisely because of the interaction and relationship between the researcher and the participants.

Ethics “is a set of moral principles that aim to prevent research participants from being harmed by the researcher and the research process,” (Liamputtong 32). In this definition, the term ‘research participants’ refers to human subjects. A human subject is a “living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information.” Private information includes first and last name, address, email, phone number, social security number, etc.

In qualitative research, potential ethical conflicts can arise at any time during a study. For example, a researcher may encounter conflicts in gaining access to a community or group, find that his or her presence is impacting participants behaviors or responses, or unintentionally inject biases or subjective interpretation into the data.

Here are some tips to avoid ethical problems or conflicts during a qualitative research study:
