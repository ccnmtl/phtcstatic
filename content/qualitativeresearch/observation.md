<div class="qualitativeresearch"><div class="pageblock"><p>Observation, as a qualitative method, is the “systematic noting and recording of events, behaviors, and artifacts in the field,” (Schensul 107). There are two main ways to engage in observation as a qualitative method: as a participant or as an observer. In both types of observation, the researcher is tool for data collection, and all data are filtered through the perspective of the researcher. Therefore, the quality and importance of recorded observations depends on the researcher’s skills, ability to maintain objectivity, and the opportunities he or she has to engage in observation.</p>
<p>Field notes are the researcher’s record of observation periods, and it is field notes that are examined during the analysis phase of the study. Therefore, more complete and accurate field notes make data analysis that much easier. Maintaining good field notes requires recording observations in detail with concrete examples and information and establishing a schedule to work on field notes on a regular basis. Field notes are not a researcher’s diary. “Inferences and personal observations, reflections, hunches, and emotional reactions of the researcher can be recorded separately from…field notes that describe the event or situation,” (Schensul 115).</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for writing good field notes (Schensul, 115-119):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use detailed, non-judgmental, and concrete descriptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe behaviors using verbs that depict the actions, rather than in terms of what the behaviors mean to the observer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe an individual’s appearance in detail, but leave out inferences about what their appearance means to the observer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the physical environment as if looking through the lens of a camera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include exact quotes, where possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use pseudonyms to ensure anonymity and confidentiality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sequence observations in the order in which they occurred</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include relevant history and/or context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record the date, place, and time of the observation, as well as the name of the researcher</p>
</li>
</ul>
