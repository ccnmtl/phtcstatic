A choice between research methods rests fundamentally on a set of decisions about the questions a researcher wants to answer and the practicality of gathering the kind of data that will answer those questions. 

Generally speaking, some key features of qualitative research include:

* Answers “how?” and “why?” For example, how do overweight adults make food choices based on calorie-labeling at fast food restaurants?
* Gathers open-ended and textual data
* Collects data by asking and observing
* Produces information about:
    * How people feel about situations
    * How things are done (for example, procedures)
    * How people or organizations behave

Whereas, some key features of quantitative research are:

* Answers “how many?” “when?” “where?” For example, does the strength of relation between amount of daily aerobic exercise and blood pressure differ for male and female adults?
* Gathers numerical data
* Collects data through surveys, logs, forms, etc.
* Analyzes numeric information to:
    * Classify and count a characteristic(s)
    * Construct statistical models to explain observations
