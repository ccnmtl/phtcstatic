<div class="qualitativeresearch"><div class="pageblock"><p> A choice between research methods rests fundamentally on a set of decisions about the questions a researcher wants to answer and the practicality of gathering the kind of data that will answer those questions. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, some key features of qualitative research include:</p>
<ul>
<li> Answers “how?” and “why?” For example, how do overweight adults make food choices based on calorie-labeling at fast food restaurants?</li>
<li>Gathers open-ended and textual data</li>
<li>Collects data by asking and observing</li>
<li>Produces information about:</li>
<ul>
<li type="circle">How people feel about situations</li>
<li type="circle">How things are done (for example, procedures)</li>
<li type="circle">How people or organizations behave</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Whereas, some key features of quantitative research are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answers “how many?” “when?” “where?” For example, does the strength of relation between amount of daily aerobic exercise and blood pressure differ for male and female adults?</li>
<li>Gathers numerical data</li>
<li>Collects data through surveys, logs, forms, etc.</li>
<li>Analyzes numeric information to:</li>
<ul>
<li type="circle">Classify and count a characteristic(s)</li>
<li type="circle">Construct statistical models to explain observations</li>
</ul>
</ul>
