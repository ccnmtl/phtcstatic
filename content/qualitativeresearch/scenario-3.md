Jonathan realizes that studying the “Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby” classes alone will not be enough to answer the team’s question as to why the “The Better Bottle” program is underutilized. He pauses to reflect on the target audience for the program and picks up one of the free educational pamphlets available in the office. Jonathan reads a couple of paragraphs and thinks to himself that the language in the pamphlet may be a bit too advanced for the women in the program.

<i>Incorrect:</i> Not quite yet! Sending another survey to women who have completed the program may be something that the program team considers after completing the qualitative study. But without the additional, detailed qualitative data it will be difficult to craft new, informed survey questions. How will they know what to ask about? Instead, the team should consider doing a thorough review of the information that is readily available to them – the program materials and activity records. These materials can produce a wealth of information, if they are reviewed and assessed in a systematic manner. Click the forward arrow to learn about qualitative document analysis.

<i>Incorrect:</i> Good idea! The women currently enrolled in the program have been exposed to some of the participant materials and resources. They can provide feedback on those documents, but what about the trainers’ manuals, activity records, etc.? The team should consider reviewing all of the information that is readily available to them. These materials can produce a wealth of information, if they are reviewed and assessed in a systematic manner. Click the forward arrow to learn about qualitative document analysis.
