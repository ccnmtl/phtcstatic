Having reviewed the five approaches to qualitative research, Maxine begins to move on to teach Jonathan the basics of qualitative data collection. She emphasizes to Jonathan that the purpose of data collection is to gather good information to answer a research question(s). Data collection is a process comprised of 7 general steps or procedures. Thinking through these steps during the planning stages of a study can help to prevent unnecessary problems and ensure smooth execution of the study design.

            <h3>Locating site/individual</h3>
            <p>Selecting the right person, people, or group for study is critical to answering a qualitative research question. Take the time to think through questions such as, who will you study? What makes a person an appropriate participant for your study? Are all participants located at a single site or from multiple sites?</p>

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="gaining" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="gaining-tab">
            <h3>Gaining access and making rapport</h3>
            <p>Determine the best way to approach or access the study participants and how to build a relationship and establish trust with those individuals. Proceed with ethics in mind; seek permissions from IRB and establish procedures to ensure informed consent. Questions to consider include: do I need a gatekeeper to make introductions? Do the study participants have a history or previous experience with a research study? If so, what are his/her/their attitudes towards research?</p>

            <h3>Purposefully sampling</h3>
            <p> Purposive sampling is the non-random (non-probability) selection of individuals and sites because they can inform an understanding of the research problem. Common types of non-random sampling techniques include:</p>

            <h3>Collecting data</h3>
            <p>The most basic methods of information collection are interviews, observations, and document/audiovisual material review. New forms of data emerge all the time (e.g. blog posts, social media posts, emails, text messages, photovoice). There are methods that are commonly used for each of the five approaches, however a researcher is not limited to the common methods. Each method has advantages and limitations that must be considered when deciding which to use.</p>

            <h3>Recording information</h3>
            <p>Determine the best and/or most appropriate way to record data. It is good practice to audio record conversations and interviews, for the purpose of transcription and data analysis. However, participants must consent to being recorded. Traditional pen-and-paper records include pre-designed forms to record information during observation periods or interviews. Using forms, as opposed to blank pages, enables organized note-taking and focus on the participant/situation.</p>

            <h3>Resolving field issues</h3>
            <p>It is important to think through and anticipate in advance possible field issues that may arise during different points of data collection (i.e. entry and access, types of information collected, and ethical issues) so that solutions can be developed in advance and available to implement, if issues do arise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="storing" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="storing-tab">
            <h3>Storing data</h3>
            <p>Storage of data will vary depending on the type of information collected. IRB requires that the researcher explain how data will be stored and protected. Basic principles of data storage and handling include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Backup computer files</li>
            <li>Use of high-quality audio recording devices and testing devices in advance</li>
            <li>Develop a master list of information collected</li>
            <li>Mask identifying personal information of participants</li>
