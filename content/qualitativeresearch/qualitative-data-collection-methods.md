Now Maxine and Jonathan are ready to begin talking about the types of data collection methods commonly used in qualitative research. Although she will talk about each method individually, Maxine explains that qualitative research is inherently multi-method. As evidenced from their previous discussions, there is no one, single “correct” method to be used with each of the five approaches. However, there are methods that are better suited to certain approaches. 

Qualitative research promotes using multiple methods concurrently or sequentially in order to collect the most, detailed, and comprehensive data available. Thoughtful planning is required in order to execute data collection, regardless of the number of methods employed. Selection of a method, or methods, depends on the following:

* Study approach
* Research question(s)
* Funding available
* Supplemental resources available
* Project team’s skill/experience
* Sensitivity of topic/phenomenon being studied

Let’s follow as Jonathan learns about qualitative data collection methods and suggests which to use to gain a better understanding of “The Better Bottle” program utilization.
