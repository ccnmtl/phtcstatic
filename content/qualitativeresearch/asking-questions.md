According to Liamputtong (46), “there are two broad ways to of asking questions: thematically to produce knowledge and dynamically to enhance the interpersonal relationship in the interview. A good question should be composed of both types of questions.” Through thematic questions, the researcher addresses the “what” of the interview. Dynamic questions, on the other hand, get at the “how” of the interview and, ideally, contribute to encouraging good interaction, conversation flow, and participant motivation to share. 

## General tips for writing questions

* Write questions that are short and easy to understand. 
* Avoid using jargon in wording questions.
* Ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions encourage open dialogue and a rich discussion.
* Avoid dichotomous questions. A dichotomous question has only 2 possible answers, such as yes or no.
* Avoid leading questions. A leading question forces a participant to respond in a certain way or with a specific answer.
