{{< figure src="/img/assets/jon-max-computer.jpg" alt="" class="img-response" name="" usemap="">}}</div><div class="pageblock"><p>As Maxine mentioned earlier, thoughtful planning is required in order to successfully execute in-depth interviews or focus groups. Key questions to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who will be recruited? How will you recruit?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where will the interview be held?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What questions will be asked?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who will facilitate the interview?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will the interview be recorded? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a great deal of overlap between planning for an in-depth interview or a focus group. As with many aspects of the qualitative research process, there are no “right” or “wrong” answers. Maxine tells Jonathan that the answers to the above questions can be applied to both methods, and that the guidance offered in this part of their discussion should be adapted to reflect the real-world constraints of a project. Management of data collection will depend on time, funding, personnel availability and skills, and other related project resources. </p>
<h4>Who will be recruited?</h4>
<p>Sampling is an important consideration during data collection planning. How will you find or locate potential interviewees? What characteristic(s) or experience(s) does the individual need to have in order to be eligible for inclusion in the study? </p>
