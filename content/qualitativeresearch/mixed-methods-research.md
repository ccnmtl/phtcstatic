<div class="qualitativeresearch"><div class="pageblock"><p>There are also research questions that lend themselves to both types of research. Mixed methods research incorporates both qualitative and quantitative research methods into a study design. Mixed methods research “involves the collection or analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data in a single study in which data are collected concurrently or sequentially, are given a priority, and involve the integration of the data in one or more stages of the process of research,” (Handbook of Mixed Methods). </p>
<p>Benefits of mixed methods designs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opportunity to examine different facets of a phenomenon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to maximize the strengths and minimize the limitations of quantitative and qualitative research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential to increase stakeholder confidence in the overall findings</p>

</ul>

If the team already conducted a quantitative survey and analyzed that data, and we are now designing a complementary qualitative study to better understand the survey results, could this actually be considered a mixed methods study? Maxine smiles and tells Jonathan that he is a very quick learner and this could be thought of as mixed methods research. But Maxine advises Jonathan to focus on just the qualitative study for now.</p>
