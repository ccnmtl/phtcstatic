Document analysis is defined as the systematic analysis of existing and/or original materials. In this type of data collection, all materials collected are reviewed and assessed on a standardized set of criteria or issues. Developing specific forms to guide document assessment can help guide the research team in what to look for and ensure consistency between researchers and documents (Creswell 135). 

Documents, artifacts (e.g. man-made objects such as coins, items of clothing, and tools), and other materials are relatively easy to work with and they can provide valuable context and background information, including major events, crises, conflicts, etc. However, locating materials can sometimes pose a challenge, as can obtaining permission to use private materials. Finally, researchers should be conscientious when reviewing materials of another culture; in these cases, misinterpretation due to cultural differences is possible.

Examples of documents suitable for analysis include, but are not limited to:

* Study participants’ journals or diaries (kept for study purposes)
* Public documents—official memos, meeting minutes, records
* Newspapers and magazines
* Advertisements
* Archived documents
* Study participants’ letters, emails, blogs, social media posts, and/or text messages

Examples of audiovisual and other materials suitable for analysis include, but are not limited to:

* Video recordings
* Audio recordings
* Photographs
* Clothing
* Décor
