<div class="qualitativeresearch"><div class="pageblock"><p>Document analysis is defined as the systematic analysis of existing and/or original materials. In this type of data collection, all materials collected are reviewed and assessed on a standardized set of criteria or issues. Developing specific forms to guide document assessment can help guide the research team in what to look for and ensure consistency between researchers and documents (Creswell 135). </p>
<p>Documents, artifacts (e.g. man-made objects such as coins, items of clothing, and tools), and other materials are relatively easy to work with and they can provide valuable context and background information, including major events, crises, conflicts, etc. However, locating materials can sometimes pose a challenge, as can obtaining permission to use private materials. Finally, researchers should be conscientious when reviewing materials of another culture; in these cases, misinterpretation due to cultural differences is possible.</p>
