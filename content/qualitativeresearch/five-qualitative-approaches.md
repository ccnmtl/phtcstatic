With this basic information covered, Maxine is ready to delve into the specifics on qualitative research. She tells Jonathan that so far they have talked about qualitative research as though there was only one way to approach it, so his first lesson will focus on five approaches, or general conceptual perspectives, from which researchers consider and design qualitative studies.  Basic understandings of the five approaches will provide additional background to enhance his understanding of qualitative research. However, Maxine knows that practically speaking, it is unlikely that Jonathan will utilize all of the approaches in his current and future work at the health department.

Here is a list of the qualitative approaches Maxine will introduce:

1. Narrative Research
2. Phenomenology
3. Ethnography
4. Grounded Theory
5. Case Study
