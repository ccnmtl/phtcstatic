Sometimes it is necessary for the researcher to assume the role of a participant in conducting observations. A method typically used in ethnography, participant observation entails that the researcher immerse and involve him/herself in the field  “in order to record the routine daily activities, behaviors, etc. of people in the field setting,” (Schensul 91). Generally, the researcher will spend an extensive amount of time in the field. By spending time in the field the researcher is able to learn from firsthand experiences in the setting and build relationships and foster trust among the community members.

Immersion and involvement in the field are features of participant observation that set it apart from other data collection methods; however, they also generate several unique issues which must be considered before one enters the field.

__Entering the field.__ The researcher is an outsider who has to break into a community or culture. His/her presence in the community may impact or affect what is observed, for example, community members may behave differently in the researcher’s presence than they normally would. Building relationships, trust, and respect with community members is crucial to the researcher’s success in the field.

__Working with a gatekeeper.__ A gatekeeper is an influential, well-known, and/or respected member of the community who can provide an introduction to the community and can serve as a reference providing information and insight into community behaviors, events, activities, etc.  Having the support of a gatekeeper can ease entrance into the community and allow the researcher to begin establishing his/her own relationships with the community. The key is to find the right person to serve the role of gatekeeper.

__Setting aside time to work.__ Once in the field, a researcher may want to be as actively involved and participatory as possible in the community. However, a researcher will set boundaries and limits around his/her participation. Establishing a routine is one way to set boundaries. The purpose here is to give the researcher time to review, expand, and reflect on the field notes and firsthand experiences. Do not depend on memory or recall!

__Setting aside personal time.__ Long-term immersion in the field can be difficult for the researcher on a personal level. It is important to take breaks from the field from time to time to reflect on work and cope with stresses related to immersion.
