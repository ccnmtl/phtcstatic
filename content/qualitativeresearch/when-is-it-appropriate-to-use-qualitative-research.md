<div class="qualitativeresearch"><div class="pageblock"><p>Qualitative research is commonly used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reveal the “story behind the numbers.”</strong> Typically, qualitative research is used to gather or solicit information in order to better understand an issue, context, problem, or setting. This information may be needed to further explore an issue or problem in greater depth or detail, to fill in gaps when only partial information exists, or to provide basic, essential background or context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage participants actively in the research process.</strong>  During data collection, researchers engage with research participants. Building rapport and fostering trust with study participants is critical, as this relationship may empower or convince the participant to share their story with a skilled researcher who is attentive and actively listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Give voice” to the participants/population of interest.</strong> Direct contact with study participants provides an opportunity for participants to express their thoughts and feelings in their own words. The narrative data produced by qualitative methods includes quotes that can be incorporated in reports as evidence or support for findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generate new insight.</strong> Design flexibility allows researchers to adapt the study design as situations change or to pursue new paths of discovery as they emerge. This flexibility allows researchers to pose new questions or follow-up on previously unconsidered topics that the participants may introduce during data collection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
