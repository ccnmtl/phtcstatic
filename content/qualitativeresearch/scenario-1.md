<div class="qualitativeresearch"><form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>Jonathan reviews the survey results one more time. It could be helpful to go back to talk to the former program participants to get more information about their responses. However, these women have completed the program and no longer come to the office for any activities. Given that the women live all over the county, Jonathan thinks it may be difficult to get the women to come back to the office just to talk about their experience.</p>

<p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect: </span>Given that the women have already completed the program and do not regularly travel to the health department, it may not be necessary to ask the women to make the trip there unless it is for a specific reason. Do you want to talk to participants in the environment where the program took place? Would a phone call suffice? Do you want to get all the participants together and hear about their experiences from a group perspective? If you do decide to ask the women to travel, be prepared for fewer people to be available and, if budget allows, offer a small incentive for their time and travel expenses. Alternatively, speaking with the women individually, by conducting an interview, would be a good way to gather more detailed information about their experience in “The Better Bottle” program, and an interview can be done either on the phone or in-person if staff can travel to them.

<p><span class="correct">Correct: </span>Good suggestion! Given that the women have already completed the program and do not regularly travel to the health department, it would likely be more feasible to try to speak the women individually by conducting an interview. If budget and time allow, a staff member can travel to the women’s homes to speak with them in person; if not, a phone interview would suffice.

<p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect: </span>Even though the women have completed the program, they still have valuable information to share about their experiences and participation. Depending on the circumstances, the women may be amenable to having a short conversation, or interview, with a staff member, either in-person or on the phone.
