He compared and contrasted qualitative and quantitative research, reviewed the major approaches of qualitative research in public health, and examined common qualitative data collection methods. </p>
<p>Jonathan understands that qualitative data can come in several forms and from a variety of sources. After completing his lessons, he decides to propose the following methods to the team to collect data on the “The Better Bottle” Program:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In-depth interviews with women who are currently participating in program activities to gain an understanding of why they decided to enroll in the program and in particular activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus groups with pregnant women who are not currently participating in program activities to gain an understanding as to why they have not enrolled in the program</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observation of face-to-face training and educational classes to see exactly how the curriculum is being taught to participants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of promotional materials to assess the literacy level and determine its appropriateness for the target audience</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maxine’s lessons served as a basic overview for Jonathan to become familiar with qualitative research. To read more about any of the topics Maxine addressed, click forward to see the “Further Reading” list.</p>
