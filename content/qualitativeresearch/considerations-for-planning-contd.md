<div class="qualitativeresearch"><div class="pageblock"><h4>Where will the interview be held?</h4>
<p>The location of the interview can impact individuals’ ability and willingness to participate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A convenient location for participants should be selected; convenience includes travel time and ease of access. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If public transportation is available, choose a location that is easily accessible by public transport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the location in light of the interview topic, as well, especially if the interview is on a sensitive topic. The location should be a neutral space, where the participants feel free to openly and honestly discuss the topic(s) at hand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The interview space itself requires some consideration, as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select a quiet, private setting in which to conduct the interview. Part of the interviewer’s job is to make the participant feel comfortable sharing, to ensure that comments are confidential, especially regarding topics of a sensitive nature. Outside noise can also affect an interview, particularly the interview recording. Background noise can often drown out the words of the participants being recorded, which could result in difficulties during data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not always possible to conduct an interview in-person; in those situations, a phone or Skype interview is always an alternative. If conducting a phone interview, the researcher should still select a quiet, private setting sensitive to the points above. The researcher should also suggest that the interviewee find a quiet, private setting so that he/she is comfortable speaking and that no outside noise disrupts the conversation or the recording.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>How will the interview be recorded?</h4>
<p>There are several advantages to recording an interview as it takes place. Experienced interviewers recognize that they cannot focus their attention on the conversation while simultaneously writing down verbatim responses of the participants. Recording can save time by allowing the interviewer to actively focus on what is being said and to follow-up appropriately for additional detail and clarification. Moreover, audio recording the interview can ease the process of data analysis because it will produce a transcript of the conversation and thus increase the likelihood that no statements by participants are missed or excluded. A good rule of thumb is to have two recorders available, just in case one fails.</p>
<h4>Who will facilitate the interview?</h4>
<p>Interviewers should remain neutral and non-judgmental in the face of confidential information and possess the capacity to be sensitive to feelings that are being experienced by participants. Some studies have shown that, especially for young people, race and gender matching the interviewer to the characteristics of the population can help facilitate the flow of conversation and accuracy and quality of information provided by respondents. That said, the best interviewer is one who is skilled at active listening and can maintain control of conversation, asking follow-up and probing questions as necessary and paying attention to body language, verbal, and non-verbal cues. Active listening is a critical skill to portray that the participant’s views are valuable and useful.</p>
