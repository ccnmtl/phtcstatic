How will the program team know if the results from the qualitative study, using the data collection methods Jonathan selected, can be trusted?</p>
<p>In quantitative research, validity is “the extent to which a measure actually measures what it is intended to measure,” (Rossi 436). However, as Denzin & Lincoln explain, “validity in qualitative research has to do with description and explanation and whether or not the explanation fits the description,” (Denzin & Lincoln, 393). Lincoln and Guba created standards of quality and verification on which to evaluate the trustworthiness of qualitative research, which parallel standards for quantitative research (validity, reliability, objectivity, and external validity/generalizability) (Lincoln and Guba, 1985).</p>

<li>Confirmability - the degree to which the findings and conclusions can be corroborated or confirmed by others</li>
<li>Dependability - the degree to which findings and conclusions are consistent and could be repeated</li>
<li>Transferability - the degree to which the findings and conclusions can be transferred to other contexts or settings</li>
<li>Credibility - the degree to which the findings and conclusions are credible or believable from the participantsâ€™ perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several common strategies used by qualitative researchers to enhance the validity of study findings. It is generally recommended that at least 2 of the strategies listed below are incorporated into any qualitative study (Creswell 209).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Thick, rich description.</b> Inclusion of detailed, written narrative used to provide as much textual imagery as possible so that readers will be able to clearly see how conclusions were drawn</li>
<li><b>Triangulation.</b> Examination of multiple and different sources, methods, theories to show convergence within and across the data or help to explain divergence in the findings.</li>
<li><b>Extensive quotations.</b> Inclusion of direct quotes from participants that support findings and conclusions</li>
<li><b>External audits.</b> Examination of the study design and product by an external agent(s) or researcher to determine whether or not the findings, interpretation, and conclusions are supported by the data.</li>
<li><b>Peer review or debriefing.</b> Review of research process by other researchers who ask questions about methods, meanings, and interpretations. This strategy is analogous to interrater reliability.</li>
<li><b>Member check.</b> Review and comment on the accuracy of the findings by the participants themselves.</li>
</ul>
