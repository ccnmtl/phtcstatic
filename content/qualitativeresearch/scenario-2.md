<div class="qualitativeresearch"><form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>Jonathan studies the survey results on “The Better Bottle” program activities. It is clear from the survey data that there is an unequal distribution of participants across program activities; in other words, the women participate in some activities more than others. The bi-monthly breastfeeding classes seem to be well attended, while the bi-monthly “Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby” nutrition classes only have a handful of women in each session. In addition, the satisfaction data show that participants are only somewhat satisfied with the program. However, satisfaction data are only reported for the program as a whole, not by each activity. Jonathan begins to think that this is something to look into.</p>

<p><span class="correct">Correct: </span>Great suggestion! Sitting in on a class session to observe the goings on firsthand is an excellent way to gain a better understanding of the “Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby” classes.

<p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect: </span>Good idea! Speaking with the instructor is one way to gather additional information on the “Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby” classes, but she is only going to provide you with one perspective. Before speaking with the instructor, it may be beneficial to sit in on a class. After observing a class, you will be better able to prepare for an interview, such as knowing specific topics or issues to discuss.

<p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect: </span>Good idea! Reading through the “Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby” course materials could shed some light on why participants don’t attend these courses, especially if you are unfamiliar with the materials to begin with. However, you should also consider sitting in on a session so that you can experience the class firsthand. Observations made during the class may focus your attention on particular materials or aspects of the materials.
