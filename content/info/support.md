## What browsers should I use for these training modules?

The learning modules are best viewed in the following browsers:

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://getfirefox.com)
* [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)
* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge), or at least [Internet Explorer 11](http://windows.microsoft.com/ie/) for Windows.

These modules are viewable on desktop and mobile devices. There are a few interactive activities that are not optimized for smaller mobile device. For those activities, we suggest you use wider screen devices.

## Are the learning modules accessible using assistive technologies?

We developed these modules such that they can be accessed by all users with differing abilities. The PHTC modules have been tested with [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/), the screen reader by Apple. We also audited these modules using Google’s [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool, and they scored over 85 percent in accessibility performance.

There are videos and a few interactive activities that are not optimized for assistive technologies. We aspire to make these learning modules accessible to all learners, so please email phtc@columbia.edu if you have any additional questions.

## The interactive activities or quizzes are not working.

First, check if your browser is listed on the supported browser list of this website. Then check the JavaScript setting for your browser. If it is disabled, turn JavaScript on.

If the activities are still not working properly, please send us an email detailing what went wrong, which operating system you're on, and the browser version you're using.

## Can I save my answers in the activities and quizzes?

The interactives and quizzes in PHTC modules store your responses locally and temporarily, only for the page’s lifetime. Navigating away from an interactive or quiz resets the responses. We suggest you print each interactive or quiz for your records.

## Can I undo my responses in the activities and quizzes?

Yes, you can undo your responses in the activities by reloading the page. However, note that once you reload, all of your responses will be reset. The interactives and quizzes store your responses locally and temporarily, only for the page’s lifetime.
