The New York City-Long Island-Lower Tri-County Public Health Training Center (“the Center”) is a joint project of the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and Stony Brook, State University of New York’s (SUNY) Graduate Program in Public Health (SB-GPPH), in collaboration with the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH), and the five county health departments of Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. Through a grant awarded by the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Center was established in September 2011 as one of thirty-seven PHTCs nationally. As such, it is tasked with improving the Nation’s public health system by strengthening the technical, scientific, managerial, and leadership competencies and capabilities of the current and future public health workforce.

The mission of the Center is to enhance the current and future public health workforce’s ability to effectively deliver the 10 Essential Public Health Services to communities in New York City and Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. To fulfill this mission, the Center works directly with each partner health department to tailor and target its efforts to meet the training needs of the workers. Specifically, the Center:

* Assesses the public health workforce needs at each health department and assists in the planning and development of training programs to meet identified needs
* Trains the public health workforce through face-to-face and distance-based learning opportunities
* Arranges collaborative projects for faculty members and students to enhance public health services to medically underserved communities
* Establishes and strengthens field placements for students in public health departments to ensure the growth and knowledge of the future public health workforce

The Center has a decade-long history of successfully providing much needed high quality, competency-based training through its work as a partner of the HRSA-funded New York-New Jersey Public Health Training Center (NYNJ-PHTC) with the University at Albany School of Public Health and the University of Medicine & Dentistry at New Jersey School of Public Health. The Center strives to maintain the level of excellence established by the NYNJ-PHTC, and to continuing serving as a key continuing education and training resource for public health workers.
