<td valign="top"><p><font face="Courier New"> MODERATOR: .so you   can make a little special effort to talk to those folks.  Okay.    What do you think are the.the groups that are at the greatest risk?<br>
      W3: Between ages   seventeen and twenty five!<br>
      MODERATOR: Uh   huh.  Okay. And -<br>
      W1: I'd say lower   than that.  Because I know [unclear].   .because they getting' to have a body like a woman and [unclear].</font></p></td>
<td valign="top"><p>DOUBTS ABOUT DATA QUALITY: I can’t interpret this clearly,   must have a conversation with the transcriber about the quality of this data.   There are too many “unclear” passages for me to interpret this data.</p>
<p>SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT A PARTICIPANT WAS “REALLY” SAYING: "I think that Respondent is making a link between experiencing   physical / pubertal changes and sexual activity or promiscuity here, but I am   not sure. Need to confirm this in the tapes. </p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><p><font face="Courier New">MODERATOR:   Okay.  And, um, who else besides   teenagers will get into anything that's out there to be gotten into?<br>
      W2: Drug users.<br>
      W3: Battered   women.  Women who are facing domestic   violence. <br>
      MODERATOR: Okay, uh   huh.  Um..<br>
      W4: Gays.  Gay people.<br>
      MODERATOR: Okay.<br>
      MODERATOR: Say   what?<br>
      W5: That HIV comes   from gay people.<br>
      W2:  They say that it came from monkeys.  You know, they got a lotta [unclear].</font></p></td>
<td valign="top"><p>A MENTAL NOTE TO PURSUE AN ISSUE FURTHER: “the literature   indicates that stigma towards sexual minorities is high among heterosexual   populations at risk for or infected with HIV; this respondent turns that   conventional wisdom that on its head. I will explore the issue of stigma   further to see how it looks among women in the other focus groups.” </p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><p><font face="Courier New">MODERATOR:  Gay people were like the first people to   have it in big numbers in the U.S.[unclear]</font></p></td>
<td valign="top"><p>THE RESEARCHER’S RELATIONSHIP WITH PARTICIPANTS: “The   moderator must be neutral at all times. There may be some biases at play here   with regard to her views on HIV transmission. Must be sure to bring this up   in our next meeting.” </p>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><p><font face="Courier New">MODERATOR:   Okay.  And what kind of drug use do you   get in this area?<br>
      W1:  Cocaine.<br>
      W2:  Crack<br>
      W1: Crack.<br>
      (The other women   repeat "crack" in agreement.)</font></p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>A NEW HYPOTHESIS THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN A PUZZLING OBSERVATION: “it is surprising that teenagers are so aware of the amount of drug use in their community. Environmental and structural factors might be shaping HIV risk among teens, as well as adults here in Brooklynville.” </p></td>

<td valign="top"><p><font face="Courier New">W5: Weed.<br>
      MODERATOR: Right.</font></p>
