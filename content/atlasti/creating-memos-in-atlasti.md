The memo tool in ATLAS.ti can be used for margin notes.  Some other uses for the memo tool are:

* Explanatory and descriptive texts associated with other “objects”, such as quotations, codes, etc
* A place to store/take methodological notes
* As a “bulletin board” in team projects
* A location for code lists or ideas

You can create free memos, meaning memos that are not linked to any quotations or codes, or memos that are linked to data.
