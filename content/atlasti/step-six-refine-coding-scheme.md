<div class="atlasti"><div class="pageblock"><p>The aim during the refining process is to check preliminary ideas with the newly added data. For example, if you have previously generated code using only transcripts with young women, you may find that new concepts and themes emerge when you begin coding young men’s data.  </p>
<p>This is primarily done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examining overlapping codes and uncoded text</li>
<li>Continuing revision of category system </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examining o</strong><strong>verlapping codes and uncoded text </strong><br>
  Among the commonly assumed rules that underlie qualitative coding, two are different from the rules typically used in quantitative coding: </p>
<ul>
<li>One segment of text may be coded into more than one category</li>
<li>A considerable amount of the text may not be assigned to any category, as the text may not be relevant to the research objectives</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Continuing revision of category system </strong><br>
  Within each category, search for subtopics, including contradictory points of view and new insights. Select appropriate quotes that convey the core theme or essence of a category. The categories may be combined or linked under a super-ordinate category when the meanings are similar.</p>
