The aim during the refining process is to check preliminary ideas with the newly added data. For example, if you have previously generated code using only transcripts with young women, you may find that new concepts and themes emerge when you begin coding young menâ€™s data.

This is primarily done by:

* Examining overlapping codes and uncoded text
* Continuing revision of category system

## Examining overlapping codes and uncoded text

Unlike quantitative coding, in qualitative coding it is appropriate to have text that is:

* Coded into more than one category
* Not assigned to any category, as the text may not be relevant to the research objectives

## Continuing revision of category system

Within each category, search for subtopics, including contradictory points of view and new insights. Select appropriate quotes that convey the core theme or essence of a category. The categories may be combined or linked under a super-ordinate category when the meanings are similar.
