While qualitative research projects may have multiple sources of data, it is not necessary to create a new hermeneutic unit for each data source. You might think of the Hermeneutic Unit, or “HU” as an idea container. The hermeneutic unit allows you to focus your attention on the larger purpose of the project, while organizing all of your data sources in one place.  All related project docs can and should be imported into a single HU.

You are advised to save your primary documents in the same folder where your hermeneutic unit is saved. ATLAS.ti will create a container folder where the file resides; it will always expect to find units of analysis in the same file saved to the same folder. In order for ATLAS.ti to always find your documents, you should not move or rename your project files and folders after they have been created or imported.

Now, let’s learn how to assign documents. Here is a [sample transcript](/img/assets/HRWSampleTranscript.doc) you can use if you are following along with ATLAS.ti on your own computer.
