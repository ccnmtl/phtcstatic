Qualitative data comes in several forms and from a variety of sources. For your research study on HIV risk among adolescents in Brooklynville, you may have collected textual data using one or several of the following methods:

* __Semi-structured interviews__ with high school students attending an afterschool program in your community;
* __Focus groups__ with parents attending a free medical clinic; 
* __Newspaper articles__ from local publishers who have covered your topic of interest

Each of these approaches produces rich narrative data that requires both analysis and interpretation. The steps outlined in this section of the module will guide you through the basic steps of the analysis process. Keep in mind however, that the analysis process is fluid, or iterative, so anticipate that you will move back and forth between steps. 

The tasks involved in analyzing qualitative data include:
