So you’ve collected qualitative data—now what? In this section we will explore the steps involved in the analysis of your research transcripts.

By the end of this training you will be able to:

* Critically interpret the meaning of textual data using inductive reasoning
* Develop a preliminary classification scheme using interpretative reading 
* Categorize inferences with meaningful conceptual labels and/or codes
* Formluate conclusions based on relationships between established categories and/or codes
* Perform basic qualitative analysis techniques in ATLAS.ti software.  
    - Prepare primary documents for importing into ATLAS.ti’s Hermeneutic Unit
    - Employ multiple strategies to assign codes to imported text
    - Generate output of coded textual data.
    - Troubleshoot key importing, coding and output operations in ATLAS.ti
