Now letâ€™s code transcripts in ATLAS.ti. This software has tools for easy coding and code management. In ATLAS.ti there are four (4) main ways to code text. In each case you first need to first highlight a portion of text, then select your coding method of choice.

* __Open coding:__ code name is created and text is coded in a single step
* __Code-by-List:__ code is selected from an existing code list 
* __In-vivo coding:__ code name is created from highlighted text 
* __Quick Coding:__ highlighted text is coded with the currently selected code 

The following video demonstrates these four (4) basic coding options.
