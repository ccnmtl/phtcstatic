Your margin notes and initial or open codes have been tracked on the paper copies of your transcript but keeping an inventory or log of these items is useful. Since the number of codes can accumulate quickly and change as analysis progresses, it is advised that you keep a record of your emergent codes in a codebook; a great place to store the codebook is in the ATLAS.ti’s Code Manager. Maintaining this list also provides an analytic opportunity to organize and reorganize the codes into major categories and subcategories (Saldana 2005). Code manuals or codebooks become especially critical when multiple team members work together on the same project data. By creating a codebook and requiring that all team members use the codebook when coding, you can ensure a level of standardization on how different people interpret and assign codes.

The standard elements of a codebook include:

* Code name
* Code definition
* A description of when to use the code
* A description of when not to use the code
* An example of a block of coded text

Here is a sample codebook using the codes from the previous exercise.

<th class="th2" valign="top">Types of medication </th>
<td valign="top">Any discussion of the participants HIV medication history  (e.g Combivir, Epivir, Truvada)</td>
<td valign="top">Use ONLY when participants talk about types of medication they have been   prescribed by a doctor or health professional </td>
<td valign="top">Do not use when participants are discussing medication for diseases or   conditions that are not HIV OR meds that have not been prescribed by a   physician </td>
<td valign="top">My doctor just switched  me from Combivir to Videx to make it easier for me to take it.</td>

<tr>
<th class="th2" valign="top">Medication adherence </th>
<td valign="top">Any discussion of the issues associated with   taking medication as prescribed, include facilitators to medication adherence   (e.g. setting phone alarm as a reminder) as well as barriers (e.g. forgetting   or planned to not take meds) </td>
<td valign="top">Any discussion of difficulty or changes to prescribed regimen   (e.g. missed doses) </td>
<td valign="top">No coding of non-HIV meds (e.g. no HPV meds or other   illnesses) </td>
<td valign="top">And I knew I wasn't going to be able to take it   in front of him so I didn't bring my meds with me…yea I missed for the whole   time we were on vacation.</td>
