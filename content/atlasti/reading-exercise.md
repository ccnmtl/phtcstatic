<div class="atlasti"><form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>Letâ€™s practice the three types of reading. Below is an excerpt from a transcript of one of the focus groups the team conducted with HIV-positive women in Brooklynville. Jot down comments that reflect your thoughts on each type of reading. Imagine you are the moderator. You should have at least one note per type of reading (e.g., at least one note from your literal reading, one note from your interpretative reading, and one from your reflexive reading). The first one has been completed for you.</p>

<td><p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Okay, so it's like mostly, you know, central Bruekleynville like general kind of area. Okay. And what kind of, what kind of techniques do you use to do outreach and education?</p>
<p>A <strong>literal</strong> reading of this excerpt might read: “Update spelling of Brooklynville in transcripts”</p>

We need to return to the tapes to see what was said here.” An <strong>interpretative</strong> reading comment might read “this group is connecting addiction and drug use to risky sexual behavior. I wonder if male groups would agree? Where did they get this information?</p>
