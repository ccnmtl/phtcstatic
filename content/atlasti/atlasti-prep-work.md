<div class="atlasti"><div class="pageblock"><p>Before we begin this next section, we recommend that you take a little time to become familiar with the ATLAS.ti software. As we progress through the module you may want to practice the tasks that we will describe. If you are able to, please visit the ATLAS.ti website and install a free trial version of the <a href="http://atlasti.com/free-trial-version/" target="_blank">ATLAS.ti software</a>.  </p>
<p>Atlas.ti is a powerful workbench for the qualitative analysis of large bodies of textual, graphical, audio and video data. It offers a variety of tools for accomplishing the tasks associated with any systematic approach to "soft" data--i.e., material which cannot be analyzed by formal, statistical approaches in meaningful ways. It offers a powerful and intuitive work environment that is designed to keep you focused on the material itself – to cope with the inherent complexity of the tasks and the data. </p>
<p>Let’s begin with the following introductory videos.</p>
