## Creating a memo for a data segment

__Step 1:__ Select the text in the primary document for which you want to write a memo.

__Step 2:__ Click the memo button in the primary document toolbar. If the selected data segment does not resemble an existing quotation, a new quotation is created and the memo is attached. An editor opens and you can start to type. For a memo that has already been created, simply drag and drop the memo to the highlighted quotation.

__Step 3:__ An editor opens and you can start to type. For a memo that has already been created, simply drag and drop the memo to the highlighted quotation.

__Step 4:__ As with free memos, save the memo content before moving on to do something else by clicking on the Accept button. If you forget to save it, you are reminded by the program to do so before closing the editor.
