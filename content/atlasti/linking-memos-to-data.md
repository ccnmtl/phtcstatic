<div class="atlasti"><div class="pageblock"><h3>Creating a memo for a data segment</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select the text in the primary document for which you want to write a memo.<br>
<strong>Step 2</strong>: Click the memo button in the primary document toolbar. If the selected data segment does not resemble an existing quotation, a new quotation is created and the memo is attached. An editor opens and you can start to type. For a memo that has already been created, simply drag and drop the memo to the highlighted quotation.</p>
