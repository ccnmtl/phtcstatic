This serves to increase access to healthy food in existing outlets for community members who may not otherwise have had this opportunity. However, if individuals do not know that fresh produce is being offered at their local bodega or how to prepare fresh produce, the long term outcomes of decreasing prevalence of chronic disease due to food related causes may not be achieved. In constructing the logic model for changing <b>individual behavior</b> to shop for fresh produce, consider what personnel and resources will be required, activities and resulting outputs will be needed for individuals to buy and prepare fresh produce, and the outcomes of these activities.</p>",
